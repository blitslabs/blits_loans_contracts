# Overview
Blits Loans allows users to create overcollateralized loans across differet blockchains in a trustless and decentralized manner. The current implementation provides a mechanism to borrow stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain while locking Harmony (ONE) as collateral. In the case of default the lender is able to seize part of the collateral.
